// Wallet API Exercise
//
// # Description
//
// The wallet is a structure or service that keeps your assets (e.g. money) in one place
//
// # Exercise Expectations
//
// The goal here to is to establish a basis for our technical interview,
// and be able to discuss the choices you made and why. We're far more interested
// in the discussion part than receiving a perfect implementation of the following
// exercise. The exercise is not designed to take too long of your personal time,
// and doesn't have to be completed fully (although, bonus point if it is). We estimate
// it should be achieveable to complete between 1 to 2 hours of dedicated time, but
// feels free to takes as much time as needed. There's no bonus point associated
// with giving back the result in a extremely short time, specially if some parts are not done.
//
// We don't expect a specific language expertise and we expect the following exercise to be
// readable by anyone with basic programming skills, and if you prefer re-writing the following
// in the language of your choice, you are free to do so.
//
// Please keep this exercise private, and don't make your result available publicly.
// Our preference to share the result back to us is with a private gist on github or other
// private sharing service. Just sent us back the url
//
// If you spot some issues, errors, or something that as given, doesn't fit how you want to
// solve the problem, you are free to change anything here. Just make sure you're
// ready to justify the reasons.
//
// If you have any questions related to this exercise, feels free to ask them and we'll try to
// clarify as soon as possible; Although we are more interested in creative thinking, than
// just plainly getting to the right answer necessarily.
//
